## 1. Overview  

### 1.1 Purpose  
The D&D Adventure Generator is an AI-assisted tool designed to create detailed Dungeons & Dragons adventures comparable in quality and structure to official published modules. It leverages structured campaign context files and curated system prompts to produce coherent, lore-consistent, and narratively rich adventure content.  

### 1.2 Goals  
- Automate generation of D&D adventures consistent with campaign context.  
- Maintain coherence across acts, storylines, and player backgrounds.  
- Produce outputs usable by DMs as written material or for further editing.  
- Support modular expansion (e.g. quest hooks, maps, stat blocks, etc.).  

### 1.3 Target Users  
- Dungeon Masters seeking AI assistance in adventure design.  
- Writers and worldbuilders managing long-running homebrew campaigns.  
- Game developers or LLM-based systems integrating story generation pipelines.

## 2. System Components  

### 2.1 Core Inputs  
| Component | Description | Format / Example |
|------------|--------------|------------------|
| **System Prompt** | Defines tone, structure, and quality expectations (e.g., ‚ÄúWrite a D&D 5e adventure in the style of *Candlekeep Mysteries*‚Äù). | Text template (Markdown/JSON) |
| **Campaign Context File** | Encapsulates all campaign-relevant information: setting, factions, tone, major arcs. | JSON or YAML |
| **Story So Far** | Summarized narrative of previous sessions or acts. | Plain text / Markdown |
| **Premise** | High-level adventure idea (hook, main conflict, location). | Text |
| **Party File** | Contains PC data: name, race, class, backstory, motivations, relationships. | JSON or Markdown table |
| **Existing Adventure File (optional)** | For extending or revising previous adventures. | Text / Markdown |

---

### 2.2 Core Outputs  
| Output | Description | Format |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| **Adventure Document** | A fully written adventure including acts, scenes, NPCs, and encounters. | Markdown / PDF |
| **Summary / Outline** | A concise overview for quick DM reference. | Markdown |
| **Metadata File** | Structured data about generated content (themes, level range, tone, tags). | JSON |

## 3. Functional Requirements  

### 3.1 Input Handling  
- The application can **load multiple context files** (system prompt, campaign, party, etc.) and merge them into a single prompt payload.  
- The user can **select which components** to include (e.g., only premise + story so far).  
- The system should validate file formats (basic schema check).  
- Optional: auto-suggest missing components (e.g., ‚ÄúNo party file found, create sample party?‚Äù).  

### 3.2 Adventure Generation  
- The system generates an adventure with:  
  - **Acts / Chapters** (3‚Äì5 segments typical of D&D modules)  
  - **Major NPCs** with motives and dialogue hooks  
  - **Encounters** (combat, exploration, roleplay)  
  - **Locations** with descriptive text and possible events  
  - **Rewards / Consequences** tied to choices and PC backstories  
- Adventures should be **consistent** with prior context and **scalable** to party level.  
- Generation should be **deterministic** if a fixed seed or versioning mode is used.  

### 3.3 Adventure Structure (Baseline Template)  
Each adventure includes:  
1. **Title & Overview** ‚Äì name, level range, and summary.  
2. **Adventure Hook** ‚Äì reason to start the story.  
3. **Background** ‚Äì relevant lore or prior events.  
4. **Act Structure** ‚Äì divided into acts/scenes with clear goals.  
5. **Key NPCs and Factions.**  
6. **Notable Locations and Challenges.**  
7. **Resolution / Aftermath.**  

### 3.4 Output Features  
- Export options:  
  - Markdown (for editing)  
  - PDF (for distribution)  
- Optional compression of long text sections (e.g., ‚ÄúDM Summary Mode‚Äù).  
- Version tracking for iterations (e.g., v1.0, v1.1).  

### 3.5 Session Continuity  
- The system can append new adventures to an existing campaign timeline.  
- Maintains internal references (NPC continuity, unresolved threads).  
- Optional feature: *Adventure Chaining* ‚Äì uses ‚ÄúAdventure End State‚Äù as next ‚ÄúStory So Far‚Äù.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements  

| Category | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Performance** | Generate an adventure (3‚Äì5 acts) within 60 seconds for standard prompts. |
| **Reliability** | Handle malformed or incomplete inputs gracefully. |
| **Scalability** | Designed for modular expansion (e.g., stat generation, maps). |
| **Usability** | Clear CLI or GUI flow for selecting context files and output options. |
| **Extensibility** | Support for plugins (custom prompt templates, world settings). |

Would you like me to extend this spec next toward **implementation-level details** (e.g., data schemas and file structures), or toward **user workflow & UX specifications** (menus, flow, interaction logic)?
