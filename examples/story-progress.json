Over the past several sessions, they've uncovered a connection to an ancient cult that worships an aberrant entity from the Far Realm. They tracked cult activity to an abandoned mansion in the Dock Ward, where they defeated several cultists and rescued two nobles. However, the cult's high priest escaped through a portal, taking with him a magical artifact called the Eye of the Deep. The party learned that the cult plans to use the artifact in a ritual during the next full moon to open a permanent gateway to the Far Realm.",
